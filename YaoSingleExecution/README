INTRODUCTION
------------

This package contains a wrapper for the Yao protocol in the Single-Execution setting.
The wrapped protocol was implemented by EMP (Efficient Multi-Party computation toolkit, and the implementation can be
found at https://github.com/emp-toolkit/emp-m2pc.

The protocol is based on the https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/762.pdf paper.


INSTALLATION AND EXECUTION
--------------------------

1. Go in the YaoSingleExecution directory.
2. Run the make command
3. To run the program type
~ ./YaoSingleExecution [party_id] [circuit_file_name] [ip_address] [port_number] [input_file_name]
for example, in order to run p1 with aes circuit on local host and port 12345 type:
~ ./YaoSingleExecution 1 NigelAes.txt 127.0.0.1 12345 AesInputs2.txt

The output is printed to the screen in p2 side.
